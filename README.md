NASA Near-Earth Object (NEO) Tracking & Insights using Public API

About the Project:

NASA Near-Earth Object (NEO) Tracking & Insights using Public API extracts the data through API Integration. The unstructured JSON data obtained is then converted to structured data by collecting the required fields. It is then stored in SQL table as two different tables namely Asteroids and Close Approach.

In order to make the data more meaningful and readable, it is presented through UI named Streamlit. In the Streamlit UI, the user can filter the details using the filter criteria by setting the parameters. There is also one page dedicated to queries where there are 20 predefined questions. Upon selecting which would show the results in readable format.



Business Use Cases
Threat Monitoring: Analyze which asteroids are potentially hazardous based on velocity, size, and proximity.

Date-Based Exploration: Understand patterns of asteroid occurrences and visits by date.

Filtering for Insight: Help researchers or educators filter based on custom conditions like approach distance, size, or orbiting body.

Space Data Democratization: Deliver an intuitive interface for non-technical users to explore astronomical data.
